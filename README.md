Welcome! This is **`crfm-geometry-helm`** Python package, it's a fork from **`crfm-helm`** in which I'm integrating some geometrical methods (using the library [Dadapy](https://github.com/sissa-data-science/DADApy/tree/main) ) to investigate the geometry of hidden representations and a dash web app for visualization.    
I will be adding some documentation soon, but my integration are on top of the **`crfm-helm`** thus its original functionalities are preserved.
